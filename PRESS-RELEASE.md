Snakes, in space!  Online!

## Summary ##
  Galactic Tango is a 4-player online game.  Games are quick and the learning curve is low.  Users can jump in and play anytime!

## Problem ##
  While AAA gaming titles are as popular as ever, there exists a large market for quick and light games targetting casual and hardcore gamers alike.  Casual internet users do not want to spend a lot of time or money in learning a game to be able to compete and have fun.  

## Solution ##
  Galactic Tango is about as straightforward a user experience as can be while still maintaining interactive and enjoyable gameplay.  Users are not required to sign in or perform any set-up before immediately jumping into a game.  Games are very brief to allow for quick gaming sessions in between other activities.  The only controls used are the directional arrows.  Users can be competing at a high level almost immediately!
